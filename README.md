# react-node-crud-router
A basic application to demonstrate a few operations with client side routing

Steps to setup the application:
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the root folder
- Open command prompt and enter this command : npm install
( This will update all the dependencies in the application and create the node_modules folder )
- Once the dependencies are resolved, enter this command : npm start 
If the above command runs successfully, you'll see the server starting up at port 3000
- Head over to browser and navigate to localhost:3000
